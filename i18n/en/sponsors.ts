          'In Vue.js development, "designing reusable and maintainable components" is a critical challenge. However, in actual team development, we often face issues such as designs becoming complex when component interfaces are decided later, or quality inconsistencies arising when testing is postponed.\n\nOur team has been practicing Storybook-Driven Development for a year and has successfully resolved these challenges. By changing from the traditional "implementation → testing" flow to "interface definition/Story creation → implementation → automated testing," we\'ve achieved reduced rework and high test coverage.\n\nThe core of this approach is clearly defining Vue component interfaces before implementation and expressing them as Stories. Storybook\'s constraints promote good design, and automated test creation naturally becomes habitual. Even as the number of components grows, there\'s no quality variance, and new members can maintain consistent quality.\n\nI\'ll share why this approach is effective, how we successfully adopted it across the entire team, and the insights and best practices we\'ve gained from a year of practice.',
