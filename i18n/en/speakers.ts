    talkOverview:
      "Our product, built on Vue 3, had relied for years on a custom-built validation logic. However, over time, this homegrown solution began to show its limitations. A lack of documentation, inconsistent specifications, and the complexity of our proprietary setup all contributed to a growing maintenance burden. Eventually, the system became a significant source of technical debt that could no longer be ignored.\n\nIn this session, we'll walk you through how we confronted this issue. We'll share how we evaluated major Vue validation libraries—like Vuelidate, vee-validate, and Zod—what criteria guided our decision, and how we ultimately chose and implemented a new solution.\n\nBeyond just selecting a library, we'll discuss the tangible benefits we gained from the transition: comprehensive official documentation, ease of learning, and improved maintainability.\n\nWe'll also dive into real-world challenges we faced during the migration from our legacy validation system, strategies for partial coexistence, and phased rollout methods—highlighting how we bridged the gap between ideal plans and practical constraints.\n\nThis talk is especially relevant for:\n\nDevelopers struggling with the limitations of custom validation logic\n\nTeams considering introducing a validation library in a Vue 3 environment\n\nOur goal is to share insights that can help you tackle technical debt and move toward a healthier, more sustainable development experience.",

    talkOverview: `“Tired of errors from typos in route names?”
“Repeating the same boilerplate for data fetching state management?”
“Still relying on plain strings for routing—even with TypeScript?”

If these sound familiar in your Vue/Nuxt development workflow, this session is for you.

We'll dive into practical strategies for improving developer experience using \`Nuxt Typed Router\` and \`Pinia Colada\`. With automatic type generation from file-based routing, you'll get full autocompletion for route names and parameters. Declarative data fetching frees you from manually managing loading and error states.

Rich type information and declarative code don’t just help developers—they create an ideal environment for AI-assisted development as well.

We'll show you how to shift from tedious tasks to meaningful development by building a modern, AI-optimized setup—complete with real code examples and key considerations for adoption.`,

As a result, even large-scale SPAs experience noticeably smoother performance.\n\nThe Innovation of Vapor Mode\nVapor Mode eliminates the overhead of the Virtual DOM by rendering DOM elements directly from components. It requires no changes to existing APIs and delivers exceptional performance—capable of mounting 100,000 components in just 100ms.\n\nPractical Tips\nThis session will cover migration steps for existing projects, common pitfalls in the new reactivity system, best practices for using Vapor Mode, and comparisons with other frameworks like SolidJS.",

    talkOverview: `Abstract:
Web applications are no longer silent. Thanks to the evolution of the Web Audio API, WebAssembly, and GPU acceleration, browser-based audio can now rival native environments. In this talk I will guide Vue (and broader front-end) developers through practical, production-ready strategies for integrating real-time audio processing into their apps—without sacrificing performance or user experience.

Key Takeaways:
- Web Audio API & AudioWorklet – Build a solid foundation for low-latency DSP in the browser.
- RNBO → WebAssembly – Build prototype-oriented audio modules in Cycling '74's RNBO and deploy them to the web via WebAssembly.
- JUCE – High-level overview of JUCE as a widely used framework in the audio community, with a brief note on how it may relate to web workflows.
- GPU-Accelerated Audio – Explore emerging patterns that offload DSP to the GPU for massive parallelism.
- Browser Limitations – Understand current constraints and proven work-arounds.

Target Audience:
Front-end engineers, creative coders, and audio developers who want to push Vue.js beyond visuals and into immersive sonic experiences.

Prerequisites:
Basic familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript and Vue.js. No prior DSP knowledge required—concepts will be introduced from first principles.`,

It seems that we, as JavaScript/TypeScript engineers, are using Rust-based software without even realizing it—even though we have no memory of ever setting up a Rust development environment.

Let's take a fresh look at how these Rust-based tools work, especially in coordination with JavaScript.`,

I've felt the same.\n\nAt TSKaigi 2025, Anthony Fu introduced a library called `eslint-typegen`. His talk sparked my interest, so I decided to learn more about it and share what I learned in a public talk outside my company. That small act of output led to an unexpected opportunity: contributing `eslint-typegen` support to `eslint-plugin-vue`.\n\nIn this lightning talk, I'll reflect on that journey to show that *open source is closer than you think*. I'll cover:\n\n1. How a small talk and public output became the gateway to OSS contribution\n2. The technical growth I experienced through contributing\n3. The welcoming and open culture of the Vue ecosystem's OSS community\n\nI hope this story encourages more developers to take that first small step into the world of open source.",

    talkOverview:
      'Today, "UI/UX" has become a buzzword we hear all the time.\n\nBy designing user flows based on user stories and creating consistent design style guides, we aim to present a unified look and make actions clear for users.\n\nIn this talk, I hope to offer a fresh perspective on how we approach everyday design—by understanding how the human brain processes the information it receives through the eyes.',

    talkOverview:
      "In this session, I'll share key considerations for managing authentication state using cookies when building a custom auth system in Nuxt.\n\nAs of now, there are no stable third-party solutions for email and password-based authentication in Nuxt, which has led us to implement our own.\n\nI'll walk you through the challenges we faced and the practical workarounds we found—especially around why simply using the `useCookie` composable didn't behave as expected, and what we did to address it.",

      'Could "Vue Native" the Vue Version of React Native Become a Reality?\nLet\'s Take a Look at Lynx, a Next-Generation Cross-Platform Framework, and Its Vue.js Support',
    talkOverview:
      "In March 2025, ByteDance—the company behind TikTok and CapCut—announced a new open-source, next-generation mobile cross-platform development framework called **Lynx**.\n\nLynx is now aiming to support **Vue.js**, potentially offering Vue developers a mobile-native development experience with minimal learning curve—much like what React Native does for React users.\n\nThere's already exciting momentum: Vue creator **Evan You** has publicly expressed support for Vue+Lynx on X (formerly Twitter), and Vue community member **Rahul Vashishtha** has even shared a working prototype on GitHub.\n\nGiven how new Lynx is, there's still very little documentation available—especially in Japanese—and it hasn't yet gained much attention in Vue circles.\n\nIn this talk, I'd love to introduce Vue+Lynx, highlight what's already happening (including Vashishtha's prototype), and share the excitement and possibilities this could bring to the Vue community. Let's explore what the future of Vue-powered native app development might look like—together.",

    talkOverview: `At chocoZAP, we had been using external services for booking self-esthetic and self-hair removal services.
This time, we have developed our own reservation system in Nuxt.

As a result, the development team can now independently design and improve the system,
and we have built a structure that allows us to flexibly enhance API communication and authentication in-house.

In this LT, we will introduce the technical architecture and the key points we focused on.`,
